## Research Summary
Survey - 86 participants
Interview - 10 participants
Insights we gained
Less than a third of people who want to manage unnecessary spending actually do it successfully (pie chart capture)

Reasons of those who can't manage it (35 subjective responses)
(Numerical evidence) People feel the need to manage their spending but
those who haven't succeeded or haven't tried tend to not check their spending details (occasionally) or only look at the total amount.
Reverse engineering of numbers
(Numerical evidence) They don’t manage because it’s inconvenient to check and manage details - 16 out of 35 subjective responses
It's hard to change spending habits.
They don't know how to manage their spending.

Characteristics of those who manage well (23 subjective responses)
They check their spending details very often.
They review their spending every day to a week - 14 cases
They review their spending daily - 6 cases
They set a monthly budget and check how much they have spent frequently and adjust accordingly.
Splitting accounts, setting a monthly budget

Current service situation
Integrated financial apps are not designed with spending reduction at the core (rather, they need to promote financial transactions through increased spending)
Of course, there are people who manage well using integrated financial apps. However, there is no UX designed for those who want to reduce spending.
Bank apps are generally poor in usability.
Budgeting apps are services focused on people who have the will to manage money and are already doing it well.

## Solution Concept:
Help people who struggle to reduce unnecessary expenses
to easily and enjoyably
check their daily spending details,
and review their spending.
